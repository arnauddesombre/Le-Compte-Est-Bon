# LeCompteEstBon
Le compte est bon! (from French TV game "des chiffres et des lettres")

This is a standalone Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet to play the game. The embedded macros include a solver. Le compte est bon (the total is right) is a great way for any elementary / middle school student to master arithmetic; and the game will entertain any math enthusiast.

If you leaved in France in the 70's and 80's, you know the game... otherwise, check it out at<br> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Des_chiffres_et_des_lettres
